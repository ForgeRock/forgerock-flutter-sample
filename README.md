# ForgeRock Flutter Sample Collection

A collection of ForgeRock protected, cross-platform sample apps written with Flutter with a supporting (protected) API resource server.

IMPORTANT: This is not a demonstration of Flutter itself or instructional for how to build a Flutter app. This is intended to demonstrate the implementation of the ForgeRock SDKs within a Flutter app. There are many aspects to routing, state management, tooling and other aspects to building a Flutter app that are outside of the scope of this project. For information about creating a Flutter app, visit Flutter's official documentation.
